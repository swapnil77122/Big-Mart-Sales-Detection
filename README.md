This project aims to predict the sales of products at various outlets of Big Mart using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes product information, outlet details, and sales data. We employ exploratory data analysis (EDA) and use an XGBoost Regressor to predict the target variable, Item_Outlet_Sales.
